# Compressor-Decompressor
# SwingProject
This is a Java Swing basic compressor decompressor project.

# Introduction and Objective of Project
1. This is a minor project on compressor and decompressor using Java language.
2. Objective of the project is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression technique.
3. Benefits of compression include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs.
4. Only lossless conversion is used in this project to ensure no data loss occurs during compression.
5. In the project, it is ensured that the compressed files can be restored to their original form.

# Technologies used in the Project
1. Java and Java Swing
2. Java IO package is used to handle input and output streams for reading and writing data to files or other sources.
3. JFrame represents the main window when executing the project.
4. The project includes a button that, when clicked, pops up a window to select a file to be compressed or decompressed.

# Output

1. Basic UI with two buttons, the Compress button and Decompress button.

After Compression the file compressed from 49kb to 45kb.
 5. Selecting the compressed file to decompress.
